It took the attention away from myself and allowed me to focus on others. It allowed me to dive into these incredible situations and explore the world around us." - AMI VITALE (National Geographic Explorer, and filmmaker)</p>

  <!--Main content-->
  <p class="body">So my name is Sanskar and l am a learning photographer, computer nerd, editor, and student. I'm from Muzaffarpur. It is a small city in Bihar where life is better than overcrowded metro cities. I have recently passed my high schools and hoping to get into a College in the upcoming months.
   </p>
   
    <p class="body">I love travelling, mountains and photography. Apart from these things, I love creating programs for fun. I am a self-taught programmer with expertise in Python, HTML 5, CSS 3, JavaScript, React.js, React Native and Django. I am also quite good at Data science and machine learning. Currently, I am looking forward to develop a privacy-based chat application.
     </p>
     
     <p class="body">Coming from a very strict family, as my both parents are teachers, I was restricted to only studies. From my childhood, my father distanced me from sports and other co-curricular activities because he wanted me to only focus on my studies. When I was 12, I started living with my grandparents and that was the time when I started to participate in other activities .After completing my 10th, my father sent me Kota to prepare for JEE examinations. At that time I was not sure what I wanted to do with my life, until I realized there was no "single thing". I want everything. I want to climb Mountains, ride horses, play music instruments, learn new things, travel around the world, make new friends, eat almost every type of food and many more things. So I made a list of everything I wanted to do and now I am completing them one by one. Kota gave me the opportunity to focus on my goals and hobbies. Kota gave me freedom and made me a rebel, and for this I will always be thankful to this beautiful city.</p>
     
     
      <p class="body">I am not a very talkative person, but I'm also not an introvert. I love stargazing, trekking, movies and road trips. I do not think too much before doing anything. If I want to do a certain thing, I will do it. I believe that the only way to deal with this unfair world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an art of rebellion (quote by Albert camus). </p>
      
      
        <p class="body">I am aspiring to be a photojournalist/Documentary filmmaker and my dream is to work for National Geographic. The reason why I chose this as a career is that I love travelling and, I want to show the world through my perspective. I believe in equality, democracy, resistance and revolution. I know the value of freedom, and I love the idea of freeing this world from social injustice through a lens.</p>
