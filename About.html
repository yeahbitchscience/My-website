It took the attention away from myself and allowed me to focus on others. It allowed me to dive into these incredible situations and explore the world around us." - AMI VITALE (National Geographic Explorer, and filmmaker)</p>

  <p class="body">So my name is Sanskar and l am a learning photographer, computer nerd, editor, and student. I'm from Muzaffarpur. It is a small city in Bihar where life is better than overcrowded metro cities. I have recently passed my high schools and hoping to get into a College in the upcoming months.
   </p>
   
    <p class="body">I love traveling, mountains, and photography. Apart from these things I love creating programs for fun. I am a self-taught programmer with expertise in Python, HTML 5, CSS 3, JavaScript, React.js, React Native, and Django. I am also quite good at Data science and machine learning. Currently, I am looking forward to create a privacy-based chat application.
     </p>
     
     <p class="body">Coming from a very strict family, as my both parents are teachers, I had no friends. From my childhood, my father distanced me from sports and other co-curricular activities because he wanted me to only focus on my studies. When I was 14, I started living with my grandparents and that was the time when I started to participate in other activities and got some good friends. After completing my 10th, my father sent me Kota to prepare for the JEE examination, and this was the time I realized what freedom is, and what I want to do with my life. When I arrived there, I was not sure what I wanted to do with my life, until I realized there was no "single thing." I want everything. I want to climb Mountains, ride horses, play music instruments, learn new things, create apps/games, travel around the world, make new friends, eat almost every type of food, and many more things. So I made a list of everything I want to do and now I am completing them one by one. Kota gave me the opportunity to focus on my goals and hobbies. Kota gave me freedom and made me a rebel, and for this I will always be thankful to this beautiful city.</p>
     
     
      <p class="body">I am not a very talkative person, but I'm also not an introvert. I love stargazing, trekking, and road trips. I do not think too much before doing anything. If I want to do this, I will do it. I believe in no rule neither I follow the rules made by society because I believe in living life on my own terms and conditions.</p>
      
      
        <p class="body">I am aspiring to be a photojournalist/Documentary filmmaker and my dream is to work for National Geographic. The reason why I chose this career is that I love traveling and, I want to show the world with my perspective. I believe in equality, peace, democracy, and opportunity for all. I know the value of freedom, and I love the idea of freeing this world from social injustice through a lens.</p>
