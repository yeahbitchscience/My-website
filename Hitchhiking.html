  <!--Main content-->

  <p class="body">Every time when I go somewhere I try to plan everything and my every minute on that trip is kinda
    preplanned considering the budget, stay, location, timing and network connection. But this time nothing was planned,
    I just thought let's go somewhere and the next day I was on the train. I had a critical budget, no plans and had no
    idea what will happen next.</p>


  <p class="body">At that night I booked a ticket to Delhi of next day (Kota-Jansatabdi always has plenty of seats
    left). Next day I just packed my bag, charged my phone, took necessary documents, and boarded that train and believe
    me at that time I really didn't know that I will survive or not. In the next 6 hours, I was in Delhi, bought a
    general ticket till Ambala Cantt (Sleeper tickets weren't available at that time and also I didn't want to waste
    more money for a few hour journey).</p>

  <p class="imagetitle">Kota-Janstabdi Express</p>


  <p class="body">I thought now everything will go smooth but after waiting for 1 hour a train came and when I saw the
    G.C, I was like what the fuck. It was crowded like hell. This was my first time in G.C and I couldn't board the
    train because of the crowd. After 10 minutes another train came and without wasting any time I just sneaked into it.
    Anyhow, I reached Ambala Cantt. After reaching there I opened google maps and found that Ambala-Chandigarh Highway
    was just next to the exit.</p>

  <img src="./images/GC.jpeg" class="headpic">
  <p class="imagetitle">Inside View of General Compartment</p>

  <p class="body">The next thing I knew that I have to go as far as I can go on this highway by taking the lift in order
    to reach Shimla. So, I stood on one side of the road and started asking for a lift. I thought it will be easy and
    I'll get a lift within 15 minutes as shown in movies. But after struggling for like 2½ hours I was still standing on
    that spot. I was disappointed and thought let's take the bus, but this was not the way I wanted to travel. Anyhow
    after ½ hour, a tractor gave me the first lift of my life. I was happy like hell. He gave me lift till next 10 km
    and after that, I don't know why I started getting lifts. Till Shimla, I had taken more than 10 lifts from the
    tractor, mini trucks, cars and even bike. The bike owner was kind and after listening to my story, he even asked me
    for chai-paani (snacks).</p>

  <img src="./images/Ambala.jpeg" class="headpic">
  <p class="imagetitle">On Ambala-Chandigarh Expressway</p>

  <p class="body">However, when I reached Shimla it was evening and luckily I got a mini-truck that was going straight
    till Rampur-Bushar. It was good for me because it was night and with one lift I was gonna cover long distance. The
    road was narrow and kinda dangerous and the way he was driving made it more dangerous. But the old Bollywood music
    playing on his radio, a bottle of coke and cool blowing wind made the journey beautiful.
    Around 1 AM I was in Rampur. After waiting for around 20 minutes I realised that I'll not get lift till morning as
    very few vehicles were running and no one was willing to give lift to a stranger in the middle of night. So I
    boarded on a HRTC bus coming from Shimla that was going till reckong peo.</p>

  <reckong peo bus stand>

    <p class="body">The bus was scheduled to reach reckong peo around 6 AM but it reached there at 4 in the morning. It
      was chilling cold (-1° C) and the first thing I did after stepping out of the bus was to wear extra sweaters.
      After enquiring there I got to know that the first bus that goes to Kalpa starts at 8 AM. I didn't wanted to waste
      my time so I started hiking toward Kalpa ( 3 km hike). This was a bad decision because it was freezing cold out
      there and while walking my fingers and toes almost froze, but one good thing happened that I got some good
      pictures in the way. When I was halfway on my way one police officer gave me lift in bolero. He was going to Kalpa
      to pick his senior.</p>

    <img src="./images/Peo.jpeg" class="headpic">
    <p class="imagetitle">One of the few pictures i clicked on the way to Kalpa from Reckong Peo</p>
    <p class="body">Around 5 PM I was in Kalpa, the cop dropped me next to the only cafe that was open in the morning. I
      went inside, ordered tea and some snacks and also asked for a charging point to charge my phone as it was about to
      die. The owner put out the T.V plug and let me charge my phone that was a very kind gesture. After spending 1 hour
      there I thanked him and left out to explore the village. When I was exploring the village I got some hippies who
      were also wandering. After wandering for a few minutes we found a perfect place to shoot and watch the sunrise. It
      was a roof of a local with no ladders but with bars around it, it was not difficult for us to reach the top. The
      blowing freezing breeze was making it difficult for us to stay there. I took out my tripod, checked sun position
      using compass and fixed everything to shoot time-lapse. But after waiting for 1 hour I realised sunrise has
      already happened and the sun is hiding behind mighty ranges of Kinnaur Kailash and when the sun appears it becomes
      too shiny to capture it in camera.</p>

    <img src="./images/Kalpa.jpg" class="headpic">
    <p class="imagetitle">Kalpa, Kinnaur, Himachal Pradesh</p>

    <p class="body"> My hippie friends suggested me to take a room in "The Fort View" Homestay. They had stayed there
      last night and it was quite affordable as well as good. After enquiring and bargaining, I got a room for myself.
      The first thing I did after getting into my room was to turn on the geyser and take a bath. After taking bath I
      ate some food, watched T.V. and went to visit Kalpa Buddhist Monastery that was just behind my homestay. I spent
      some time there and then visited the village. In the evening I was a bit tired because I hadn't slept properly for
      around the last 3 days. I went to a small cafe to eat some snacks. There were some local who were discussing the
      new project on Sutlej River. I really do not remember what happened next but I left for my room after discussing
      with them for about 2 hours and drinking 3 cups of tea. As soon as I reached my bed I slept and woke up around 10
      AM the next day.</p>

    <img src="./images/Monst.jpeg" class="headpic">
    <p class="imagetitle">Kalpa Monastery </p>
    <p class="body"> So the next day I started trekking toward Roghi village. It is around 6 km long trek and the famous
      suicide point comes in the way. The route is narrow, dangerous but damn sexy. It is like you are walking towards
      heaven. After walking one hour suicide point came and believe me it's overrated. People were taking pictures and
      then the police came. They cleared the point as it is illegal to stand there. So, anyway I headed on my way and
      after 2 hours I reached Roghi. After exploring this beautiful village I found that marriage was happening there.
      The bride's brother also invited me to feast but I refused. After attending the wedding I started coming back
      towards Kalpa. After reaching Kalpa when I went to a grocery shop to buy coke I met Sandip. He is a good
      photographer and also owns a homestay in Kinnaur. You can check out his Instagram <a
        href=" https://www.instagram.com/confused.launda/?hl=en" class="visibal"> @confused_launda. </a>
      After talking with him I came back to my cosy bed. I thought I will edit some photos but after one hour I slept.
    </p>

    <p class="body"> Next day I woke up at 8:30 AM. I was going to take a bus because very few vehicles run on that
      route. But when I reached Kalpa bus stand, I found that the bus had already left. One local suggested me to pick
      that bus from Reckong Peo bus stand as it stops there. So I started getting down toward Peo on foot. I wasn't
      hoping to get a lift as it was morning but a tourist cab gave me lift and surprisingly he didn't charge me for
      that. Anyhow after reaching there again I got out of luck and bus had already left. So after enquiring I had only
      two options left, either try hitchhiking or wait till 12 to board a new bus. And as you know I'm not good at
      waiting so I was again on road asking for a lift. Although there were very fewer vehicles running, a car gave me
      lift that was going till Sangla. From Sangla, I got three lifts till I reached raksham. From Raksham I boarded on
      a HRTC bus to reach Chitkul.</p>
    <img src="./images/bridge.jpeg" class="headpic">
    <p class="imagetitle">Sangala-Raksham bridge</p>

    <p class="body"> Chitkul is the last village on the side of Indo-Tibetian border. It is a very beautiful small
      village with around 50 homes. Most of them are hotels and homestays. After reaching there I booked a bunk bed in
      Zostel Chitkul and went out to explore the village. In the evening there was a birthday party in our dorm and I
      was also invited. That night was fucking chilled(-4°C). Next day I woke up around 11 AM and went to visit ITBP
      border checkpoint. It is the last point till anyone goes as after that ITBP Border starts. After that, I spent
      some time near the river and then I went to the famous "India's last Dhaba" to eat. I ate Rajma-Chawal there and
      trust me it was delicious. At night around 1 AM, I left my bed to do some Astro-photography.

    <p class="body">

      I started heading toward the bridge and forest area. After reaching there I realised that the riverside was colder
      than the upper locality. Anyway, I placed my tripod and started clicking pictures. It was freezing cold out there
      and fucking bears were howling in the forest area. At that time there was only me, my phone and tripod standing in
      -5° C to take some fucking picture. Honestly speaking my both hands were shivering both from cold and fear of
      bears. Anyhow I managed to take some good pictures after struggling with ISO and shutter speed for around 2 hours.
      When I came back to my bed at around 4 in the morning my fingers were almost jammed and my phone wasn't
      recognising my fingerprint. Anyhow after drinking tea, I managed to sleep.</p>

    <p class="imagetitle">Milkyway visible from Chitkul</p>

    <p class="body"> After sleeping for around 1½ hour I woke up around 5:30 in the morning, packed my stuff and boarded
      the 6 AM bus that was going till Sangla. After that, I took several lifts to reach Narkada. After reaching Narkada
      I boarded on a HRTC bus as I had to take a train from Kalka same day. Around 7:30 in the evening I was in Shimla.
      A minivan gave me lift till Kalka. He dropped me 1 km before Kalka station around 10:30 PM. After that, I reached
      Kalka station on foot and took "KALKA MAIL" till Delhi. Around 6 in the morning I was in Delhi S Rohilla station,
      after that I took a metro till Nizamuddin station and boarded on Nizamuddin-Kota Jan Shatabdi to reach Kota. At
      last, I reached Kota junction around 8 pm in the evening.</p>

    <p class="body"> So this was the end of the most beautiful one week of my life. For me, the Mountains are love and
      leaving them are like leaving your closest ones. This trip was special for me because the life I always wanted to
      live was almost this. Everything was new, new people, new places, new food and yes new adventures. I really didn't
      knew what I am gonna do next day, everything was fucking unplanned and this is the beauty of this trip.</p>
