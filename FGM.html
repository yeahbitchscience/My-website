  <p class="detail">“It was in a closed room. Six people were there, Two women held me...and they closed my eyes so that I could not see what was happening... I had never been touched in that place before ... I still get shivers down my spine when I recall that. There was blood and immediately lots of turmeric is applied and then they put a diaper sort of a cloth thing” -Sana( Source: A Clitoral Hood a contested site)

  <p class="body">Female genital mutilation (FGM) involves the partial or total removal of external female genitalia or other injury to female genital organs for non-medical reasons. World Health Organization (WHO) classifies four type of FGM: type 1 (partially or total removal of the clitoris glans); type 2 (partial or total removal of the external and the visible parts of clitoris and the inner folds of vulva); type 3 (infibulations, or narrowing of the vaginal opening through the creation of covering seal), type 4 (picking, piercing, incising, scrapping and cauterizing the genital area). According to WHO, globally over 200 million girls alive today have suffered FGM in over 30 countries. Every year, February 6 is observed as the International Day of Zero Tolerance for FGM.</p>
  
  <p class="body">Female genital mutilation or cutting (FGM/C) is practiced in India by Dawoodi, Sulemani and Alavi Bohra communities as well as some Sunni communities in Kerala. In Bohra community it is known as “Khatna” or “khafz” while in Kerala it is known as “Sunnath kalyanam”. According to studies it is found that Type 1A, 1B and Type 4 FGM/C are practiced by Bohras in India. The procedure includes cutting of Clitoral hood and/or part of all the clitoris and ‘nicking” of the clitoral hood.</p>
  
  <p class="body"> Dawoodi Bohra a sect of Shia Islam has one million members in India. For long FGM/C or khatna as the Bohras call it remained a well kept secret , a taboo, a subject never to be discussed . Bohra girls are often lured by the promise of clothes or sweets to undergo the practice, which is either carried out by Mullanis (Traditional cutters), untrained midwives, older women in community or doctors. This procedure is carried out usually with a knife or a blade, on girls aged between six and ten.</p>
  
  <p class="body">In Bohra community the clitoris is also known as “Haraam ki boti” or “Source of sin”or more simply “unwanted skin”. The idea behind cutting off this part of the vagina is attempt to control women’s sexual pleasure and this is backed by decades of patriarchal belief that if a woman knows the pleasure she can receive through it, she might bring shame to the community by engaging in premarital sex and marital fidelity. The community believes that this practice will help a woman resist resist extramarital sexual desire</p>

  <p class="body">One of the biggest reason why Bohra women might not take public stand against Khatna or blindly follow the practice is the fear of Syedna , the religious leader of Bohra’s who advocates khatna as an act of “religious purity”. Khafd(Arabic term of female genital cutting) is not mentioned in any religious text, particularly in Quran. But devotee blindly follow him because questioning and disobeying him results in social boycott.</p>
  
  <p class="body">India doesn’t have any law against FGM/C. The United Nations has declared female genital mutilation a human rights violation. This practice violates the right to equality and non-discrimination , right to security and physical integrity, right to health and also right to life, and yet this practice is not banned in India. India is now becoming a hub of FGM because of the recent legal action taken against FGM  among Bohras in Australia and USA.</p>
  
  <p class="body">In November 2011 a Bohra woman posted an online petition requesting that Syedna to ban FGM. A spokesperson ruled out any change by saying “Bohra women should understand our religion advocates that procedure and they should follow it without any argument”. On 10 December 2016 (Human Rights Day), a group of Dawoodi Bohra started a online petition calling for FGM to be banned. That petition was submitted to India’s Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi. In reply to that, in May 2017 she said “We’ll write to respective state governments and Syedna, shortly to issue an edict to community members to give up FGM voluntarily as it is crime under IPC and POSCO Act 2012. if Sydena does not respond, then we’ll bring law to ban this practice in India”. </p>
  
  <p class="body">In May 2017 a PIL case was raised in India’s Supreme Court. The case was filed by Sunita Tiwari , a lawyer based in Delhi, seeking ban on FGM in India. The Supreme Court received the petition and sought response from four states and central government. The Ministry of Women and Child responded to that in December 2017 that “there is no official data or study which supports existence of FGM in India”. In September 2018 the Supreme Court referred the PIL to a five-judge constitution bench that was later sent to a larger seven-judge bench in November 2019.</p>
  
  <p class="body">This practice has no health benefits, but it only harms the women subjected to it. It can cause immediate complications, including severe pain, excessive bleeding and problem in urinating. It can also have long term effect including leading to cyst and infections. The use of dirty instruments may end up transmitting AIDS/HIV. The victim may suffer from psychological trauma(depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, low self esteem etc.) and loss of sexual sensation. In 2018, a study published by WeSpeakOut revealed that 75% of Bohra women were subjected to FGM/C. Approximately 33% of women surveyed reported that FGM/C had negatively affected their sexual life. Many said that they experienced painful urination, physical discomfort, difficulty in walking and bleeding after the procedure.</p>
  
  <p class="body"> It is scary to think that people let cut off body parts from their own precious child willfully and be happy about it. God has created them the way they are, what gives someone the right to take away something from them and their body. It should be stopped. Central Government and Supreme Court should take bold actions and make FGM/C a criminal offence to stop this kind of cruel ritual in the name of faith.</p>
